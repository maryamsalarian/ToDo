# To-Do List App

Welcome to To-Do List!<br/>
This is a simple yet powerful application built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Typescript**. The app allows you to create, edit, mark as done (or undone), and delete tasks, all while storing your data in local storage.

## Features

**Add Tasks:** Easily add tasks in an intuitive and user-friendly interface.<br/>
**Mark Tasks as Done:** Cross off tasks when they're completed. Changed your mind? No worries! You can reverse this action.<br/>
**Edit Tasks:** Quickly edit tasks when necessary.<br/>
**Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from your list when they're no longer needed.<br/>
<br/>
Please note that due to time constraints, unit tests were not implemented. However, feel free to explore and play around with the app.
